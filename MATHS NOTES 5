FAMOUS PROBAB DISTS:

1.NORMAL DISTRIBUTION:
bell shaped symmetrical around mean also knows as
guassian distribution  is continuous is PDF

ends are called tails ans they never touch x axis and touch on infinity
most points lie on centre while few on ends or tails 


2 parametres : means and standard deviation 
mean gives center and std gives spread 
need these parametres and we can draw graph

why so important :
commonaliy in nature ..is commom in nature 


STANDARD NORMAL VARIATE(Z) or STANDARD NORMAL DISTRIBUTION:

a standard normal variate(Z) is standardized form of normal distribution with mean=0
and standard deviation = 1
	
helps us to compare different disstubutions with each other and to calculate probab
using standard tables
standardization:
can convert normal to standard variate usin f formula of 
 Z = x - mean /standard.deviation


Z table :
tells us area underneath a normal distrubution curve to left of z score...

by z score we can find probab of a x value from standadard variate normal
by using z tables and z score


emperical rule : 68-95-99.7 rule of normal distribution



properties of normal distribution
1 symmetric around mean
2 measure of central tendencieas are equal mean = mode=median
3 emperical rule *** important
4 area under curve = 1 


SKEWNESS:
its not symmetrical ..means not normal distributed 

is measure of asymmetry of a probab distrbution.
 it is statistical measure that describes the
degree to which a dataset deviates from a normal distribution ...

mean mode median not equal
and one side of tail is longer
tail longer on right side = positive skew  mode < median < mean
tail longer on left side = negative skew   mode > median > mean

moments in stats ..
1st moment is mean
2 is variance or standard deviation
3 is skewness
4 is kurtosis
range is 0.5(almost symmetrical) then 1 moderately skew  then 1.5 highly skew

uses in data science :
outlier detection 
ml models algorithms linear regression expect that inp is normal distribution
hypothesis testing 
central limit theorem


4 is kurtosis
KURTOSIS:
is 4th stat moment. 
it is measure of tailedness of probab dist of real valued random var..
by fatness of tails ...its density 
use case  of kurtosis 
in finance kurtosis risk is risk associated with the possibility of extreme outcomes
or fat tails in returns either super profit or super loss


EXCESS KURTOSIS :
measure of how much more peaked or flat a dist is compared to normal dist,,
sample kurtosis - 3 = excess kurtosis

types :
leptokurtic  means positive excess kurtosis....much fatter tails
platykurtic means negative excess kurtosis..less fat tails 
mesokurtic means zero excess kurtosis  also can be said ex is normal dist........
