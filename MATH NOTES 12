ANOVA TEST:
extension of t test
But for more than 2 samples then its useful

assumptions:
normal dist
random sampling
datais independent
types:
1.one way anova:
one factor or independent var

2.Two way anova:
more than one factor or independent var
compares effect of multiple levels of two factors


✅ Step 1: Set Hypotheses
H₀: All group means are equal (no effect)
H₁: At least one group is different

✅ Step 2: Calculate Means
Mean of each group (e.g., A: 72, B: 65, C: 82)

Grand mean (average of all values combined)

✅ Step 3: Calculate Variances (Sum of Squares)
➤ SSB (Sum of Squares Between Groups):

How far each group mean is from the grand mean
Multiplied by the number of observations in each group

➤ SSW (Sum of Squares Within Groups):
How far each value is from its own group mean

✅ Step 4: Calculate Mean Squares
MSB = SSB / df₁ → df₁ = k – 1 (k = number of groups)

MSW = SSW / df₂ → df₂ = N – k (N = total observations)

✅ Step 5: Calculate F-statistic
 
✅ Step 6: Compare F-statistic to Critical F (or use p-value)
Use F-distribution table or Python to find the p-value

If p < α (e.g., 0.05) → reject H₀

| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature Selection           | Tests if feature categories differ in target mean |
| Model Comparison            | Check if model performance differs across folds   |
| A/B/C Testing               | Compare 3+ versions of product or strategy        |
| Business Experiments        | Compare branch sales based on strategy used       |
| Model Interpretation (SHAP) | See which inputs cause biggest group variation    |

IMPORTANT PROBAB CRASH COURCE:

5 IMPORTANT TERMS:

1.Random experiment:
has more than one possible outcome
not possible to predict outcome in advance


2.Trial:

refers to a single execution of random experiment.......
each produces a experiment

3.Outcome:
refers to single possible result of trial 

4. Sample Space:
is set of all possible values that can occur..
generally one random experiment will have one set of sample space

5. Event:
is specific set of outcomes from a random exp.
essentialy it is sub set of sample space...
also known a probab of something e.g coin toss..getting head is event
have single or multi outcome

we can also have multi events


**
TYPES OF EVENTS:
1.Simple Event:
also known as elementary event, that consist of one outcome

2. Compund event:
consists of two or more simple events;

3.Independent events:
two events are indpendent if occurence of one doesnt effect prob of outcome
of other 
e.g fliping coin and rolling die
P(a INTERSECTION b) OR P(A).P(B)

4. Dependent events:
two events are dependent if occurence of one effect prob of outcome
of other 
formula same as conditional probab....

5. Mutually exlusive events:
if both cant occur at same time
P(A|B)= 0 

6.Exaustive events:
set of events is exaustive if at least one of the events must occur
 when experiment is performmed..

7. Impossibe events:
not possible...
die roll to get 7.



********-***********-**********-************


PROBABILITY:
is measure of likelihood that a particular event will occur..

expressed as number btw 0 and 1 .

TYPES:
1.EMPIRICAL PROBAB:
also know as experimental probab
a type of measure that is basede on observed data rather
than theoretical asumptions
calc as ratio of times a event occur to the total number of trials 
ex..




2.THEORETICAL PROBAB:

is used when each outcome in a sample space is equally likely to occur.

ex..

--------------------
RANDOM VAR(advanced):

is a func that maps outcomes of a random process (sample space) to set of real numbers
its not a var .its a function(convert inp to out based on some logic)
denoted by capital letter

input: 
whole sample space...

output:
is real number

ex:
inp is heads and we make it as 1
tails as 0 

e.g rooling two dices..inp are dice and logic 
if based on event(e.g answer is 7)so output will be logic will be to sum sample space...




PROBABILITY DIST OF RANDOM VAR:
is list of all of possible outcomes of random var alog with 
thier corresnponding probab values,

pdf: y=f(x)  probab of x 


MEAN OF RANDOM VAR:

often called expected value..
is essentially average outcome of a random process that is repeated many times.
its a weighted average of possible outcomes of random var,where each outcome is weghted
by its probab pof occurence.

e.g rolling dice.....we perform 100 trials and find average among 100 trials,
also can be said sample mean 

VARIANCE OF RANDOM VAR:

in this we use expected value or mean of random var inplace of simple pop or sample mean
the thing we get is expected value of X 
means we find x-expected value for each x then calc average is  expected value again
and this is variance 


fromula = var(x)= E[x^2]-E[X]^2
or E[X-E[X]^2]


VENN DIAGRAM OF PROBAB:
Universal set denotes sample space and its prob is always 1
and events are denoted with circles in U

P(A) is value in A circle/total no of value

CONTIGENCY TABLE:
is easy to understand probabs 
help convert into venn 
and useful ahead

*****************
TYPES OF PROBABILITY:

1.Joint probability:
lets say we have 2 random var X and Y .joint probability of X and Y,denoted as p(X=x,Y=y) 
is probability that X takes x and Y takes y at same time


..porbability of happening 2 events at once is called joint probab
ex: we use x as pclass and y as survived in titanic set...
so we use crosstab in code to get table and
get probab of each(also can be said joint probability distribtuion....)

2. Marginal probability(simple or unconditional):
refers to probab of an event occuring irrespective of outcome of some other event.
when dealing with random var ,marginal probab of random var is simply the probability of
that variable taking certain value,regardless of other variables.

same ex as above...sums all poeple as survived regardless of pclass
same for pclass

3.Conditional probability:
important one

is a measure of probability of an event occurring,given that another event has already
occurred.if event of interest is A and event B has already occurred ,the conditional 
probab of A given B is P(A|B).

means B has been done and how it affects A pobab

formula is P(A|B) = p(A intersection B)/p(B)   or joint probab/margin probab of B
