*****CONFIDENCE INTERVAL*******
CONFIDENCE INTERVAL:

as we se point estimate result is not accurate or reliable so stats used a
concept of range which covers values in which parametre can occur or lie 
 
is a range of values within which we expect a particular populatuion parametre..like mean


CONFIDENCE  LEVEL:
usually expressed as percentage liek 95% hoe sure we are true value lies
within interval or range

formula :
confidense interval = point estimate +- margin of error


**ways to calculate CL:

1.Z-procedure(SIGMA KNOWN):

done when standard dev of population is availabe

assumptions or conditions:


1.random sampling ...sample should be random
2. known population std
3. normal dist or large sample size..if not then central limit thoerem is applied

if not above 3 then cant be applied

example above youtube ...
std =15
we calc point estimate

1-alpha = confidense level

formula CI = point estimate +- Z a/2 std/sqrt.n

confidence interval man we perfom 100 test so 95 times we will get 
result in range interval...

FACTORS AFFECTING CONFIDENSE INTERVAL:
1. Confidense level (1-aplha)
2.sample size
3.population std

this method will rarely or never be used because std of population is never available

2. T-procedure:
done when standard dev of population is not availabe
also when sample size is low


assumption or conditions:

1 random sampling...
2 sample standard deviation
3 dist normal or use clt theorem 
independent observations.....


we use in fomula instaed of std we use sample mean but tcomplexity cme that if we do
 it then we get students T distributiom(looks like normal dist but not exact)

depends on one paramter called degree of freedom (n-1) n= sample size

so we use T table in formula instead of Z table
 t alpha/2 is greater than z alpha/2 but in smaller sample rate
