APPLICATION OF HYPOTHESIS :
1.Testing the effectiveness of interventions or treatments: Hypothesis testing can be used to
determine whether a new drug, therapy, or educational intervention has a significant effect
compared to a control group or an existing treatment.

2.Comparing means or proportions: Hypothesis testing can be used to compare means or
proportions between two or more groups to determine if there's a significant difference.
This can be applied to compare average customer satisfaction scores, conversion rates, or
employee performance across different groups.

3.Analysing relationships between variables: Hypothesis testing can be used to evaluate the
association between variables, such as the correlation between age and income or the
relationship between advertising spend and sales.

4.Evaluating the goodness of fit: Hypothesis testing can help assess if a particular theoretical
distribution (e.g., normal, binomial, or Poisson) is a good fit for the observed data.

5.Testing the independence of categorical variables: Hypothesis testing can be used to
determine if two categorical variables are independent or if there's a significant association
between them. For example, it can be used to test if there's a relationship between the
type of product and the likelihood of it being returned by a customer.

6.A/B testing: In marketing, product development, and website design, hypothesis testing is
often used to compare the performance of two different versions (A and B) to determine
which one is more effective in terms of conversion rates, user engagement, or other
metrics.


**********APPLICATION OF HYPOTHESIS IN MACHINE LEARNING:**********
1.Model comparison: Hypothesis testing can be used to compare the performance of
different machine learning models or algorithms on a given dataset. For example, you can
use a paired t-test to compare the accuracy or error rate of two models on multiple 
crossvalidation folds to determine if one model performs significantly better than the other.

2.Feature selection: Hypothesis testing can help identify which features are significantly
related to the target variable or contribute meaningfully to the model's performance. For
example, you can use a t-test, chi-square test, or ANOVA to test the relationship between
individual features and the target variable. Features with significant relationships can be
selected for building the model, while non-significant features may be excluded.

3.Hyperparameter tuning: Hypothesis testing can be used to evaluate the performance of a
model trained with different hyperparameter settings. By comparing the performance of
models with different hyperparameters, you can determine if one set of hyperparameters
leads to significantly better performance.

4.Assessing model assumptions: In some cases, machine learning models rely on certain
statistical assumptions, such as linearity or normality of residuals in linear regression.
Hypothesis testing can help assess whether these assumptions are met, allowing you to
determine if the model is appropriate for the data.





CHI SQUARE TEST:
used when working with categorical data and we want to see:
1. if one var follows a certain distrubution(Goodness-of-Fit Test)
2.If two vars are associated or independent(Test of Independence)


1. Chi-Square Distribution ‚Äì Key Concepts
A Chi-Square distribution is defined only for non-negative values.

It‚Äôs right-skewed, especially for low degrees of freedom, but becomes more normal-looking as the degrees of freedom increase.

The mean = degrees of freedom

The variance = 2 √ó degrees of freedom

It is used for test statistics when comparing observed vs expected frequencies.

üü¢ 2. Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test
üí° When to Use:
You want to test if a single categorical variable follows a specific distribution.

Example: Rolling a die 60 times and testing if all 6 sides appear equally.

üìå Steps:
Set hypotheses:

H‚ÇÄ: Observed distribution = expected distribution

H‚ÇÅ: Observed ‚â† expected

Calculate expected frequencies:
Based on the assumed distribution. For a fair die ‚Üí all outcomes expected 10 times.

df=k‚àí1
k = number of categories

Compare to critical value (or use p-value)

If p-value < Œ±, reject H‚ÇÄ.

‚úÖ Assumptions:
Independent observations

Categorical variable

Expected frequency per category ‚â• 5

Distribution is fixed before testing

üü£ 3. Chi-Square Test for Independence
üí° When to Use:
You want to test if two categorical variables are related.

üìå Steps:
Set hypotheses:

H‚ÇÄ: Variables are independent

H‚ÇÅ: Variables are associated

Create contingency table with observed values

Degrees of freedom:
ùëëùëì=(ùëüùëúùë§ùë†‚àí1)(ùëêùëúùëôùë¢ùëöùëõùë†‚àí1)
df=(rows‚àí1)(columns‚àí1)
Compare with critical value or p-value

‚úÖ Assumptions:
Large enough sample size (expected freq ‚â• 5)
Variables must be categorical
Independent sampling

üìä Examples:
üé≤ Example 1 (Goodness-of-Fit):
You roll a die 60 times. Are all sides equally likely?

Side	Observed	Expected
1	12	10
2	8	10
...	...	...

Calculate 
ùúí

, check p-value, and determine if die is fair.

üß† Example 2 (Independence):
You collect data on education level vs exercise preference.
Chi-Square helps test: ‚ÄúIs exercise choice related to education level?‚Äù

üîß Python Applications
Feature selection: Check if a categorical feature relates to the target

Model evaluation: Use œá¬≤ on the confusion matrix

Exploratory data analysis: Check relationships between categorical variables

Binning continuous variables: Use œá¬≤ to find the best split

CHAID decision trees: Use œá¬≤ to split nodes based on strongest relationships

üß™ P-Value in Chi-Square:
Just like with Z or T tests:

Low p-value (< 0.05) ‚Üí Reject H‚ÇÄ (evidence of association or poor fit)

High p-value ‚Üí Fail to reject H‚ÇÄ (no strong evidence)

üîÅ Recap:
Test Type	Used For	Hypothesis
Goodness-of-Fit	One categorical variable vs theoretical dist	H‚ÇÄ: observed = expected
Test for Independence	Relationship between two categorical vars	H‚ÇÄ: vars are independent
