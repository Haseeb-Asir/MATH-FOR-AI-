**************HYPOTHESIS TESTING***********

EX...
lets say youtbe video i shoot are no white board,but i realzie average view time
on my vidoe is 5 min so i look at other creators and see they use blank board
so i now make new video now with thier format or method and average screen time
was 13 minutes....now this doesnt mean new approach was good because many facotrs 
are included .eg content topic etc....
now i do it for 5 videos and get 7,8,9,22,13 still i cant be assured
 that this method worked..

IS a method of statistical inference used to decide whether the data at hand 
sufficiently support a particular hypothesis. 
allows us to make probabilistic statement about population parameters.

important concept beforehand

1. NULL HYPOTHESIS:hO
it is statement that assumes that there is no significant effect or relationship
between variables being studied
it serves as starting point for hyp testing 
and represents or also called STATUS QUO or assumption
of no effect until proven

ex...in youtube ex above we had to say that new sstyle will gain more views so
null hyp wiill be that new style = old style means both will give same views avr


2. ALTERNATUVE HYPOTHESIS: H1 or Ha:
is statement that contradict null hyp and claims 
significant effect or relationship between variables being studied
it represents or also called RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS.

ex:
***(in hyp testing we try to false the null hyp but in the end either null will be
true or alternative will be true)


important points :
.how to see if it is null or alternative hyo..so we use rule that if nothing new 
is happening so it is null hyp

in hyp testing we try to gather evidence to reject null hyp

its important to note that failing to reject null hypothesis doesnt 
necessarily mean that null hyp was true...it means that there isnt wnough evidence
to support the alternative hyp

court lawyer ex....
*****
*2 main types of techniques:

1.REJECTION REGION APPROACH:
1. calc null or alternate hyp
2.select significance level.....(0.05 or 0.01 generally used)(it is probab of
rejecting null hyp when it was true..e.g 100 out of 5 times you rejected null hyp)
3. check assumptions ...check dist
4. decide which test is appropriate (Z test, T test,chi square test,Anova test)
5.state relevant test static...e.g Z score for Z test
6.conduct test
7.reject or not reject null hyp
8. interpret result


***SIGNIFICANCE VALUE:
ALPHA...
it is predetermined threshold used in hypothesis testing to determine whether the null
hypotheis should be rejected or not.It represents the probability of rejecting nulll
hypotheses when its actualy truE, also known as TYPE 1 ERROR
MOSTLY 5 PERCENT 
increasing alpha increases range of rejection.....

critical region or rejection is region of values that correspond to null hypothesis
at some chosen probability levl

Problem with rejection rejion approach::::
lets say we calculated Z which came 1.97 and crticial region was 1.96  so we reject 
null because of 0.01 value which is bad
if Z=15 which is rare but we do reject null hyp...
evidence strength is not told by this approach
so we use p value approach....which tellls us strength of evidence
