Density estimation :
technique to find or estimate pdf of random var 
has 2 methods :
1. PARAMETRUC DENSITY ESTIMATION:
is method of estimating pdf of random func by assuming that
 underlying distributionn belongs
 to  specific parametric family of probab dist
 e.g normal dist,exponential dist,,,etc
uses paramteres from data then using them inn formula to find pdf



2.NON PARAMETRIC DIST:
if sometime dist is not clear and not one of famous distribution family so then we use non parametric technique

..method or technique used to estimate pdf of random var without making assumptions about 
underlying dist
we dont go for parametres like mew mean or std
we use every datapoint 

advantage is doesnt requre specific dist and any graph can be plotted
disadvantage is computationally more intensive and require more data to be accurate estimate

KDE kernel density estimation is example of NON PARAMETRIC DIST....

KDE:

uses a kernel func like famous guasses kernel or also ocalled normal dist
and it makes each data point center and plots normal dist for it
using left and 
right point(standard deviation range also called bandwidth in KDE parametre) 
and then does for each point then it takes  apoint and goes up y axis and
 sees where it mathes theguasses curve and for it it adds it with the above curve
 so plots a line above on top using this 

2. CDF TO PDF :
pdf grapg y axis is density while cdf graph is exaclty precentage of 
element bleow the point 

area of pdf gives cdf while slope of points of cdf gives pdf 
do integration on pdf we get cdf
do differentiation on cdf we get pdf

HOW IS PDF USED IN DATA SCIENCE 
ex is iris dataset we have to get t know what columns will hellp us
 uderstand or predict
species 
we plot pdf for each column and see which graphs will we get ,,the on 
more distinguishing will
be useful column  for predictiing the result for ml model


HOW IS CDF USED IN DATA SCIENCE 
we decide up till the point on above pdf graph how much accurate 
we will be in quantative 
 

2D Density plots:

studying 2 culumns plots


how to study ?
cosider  like seeing mountain  from above of plane 
and color as its height toward more dark means more density
