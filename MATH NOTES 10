TYPE 1 VS TYPE 2 ERROR:

TYPE 1 (FALSE POSITIVE):
occur when sample result lead to rejection of null.hypthesis whenit was true inreal

denoted by alpha or significance level
by choosing alpha value we can control risk of managing type 1 error


TYPE 2 (FALSE NEGATIVE):
occur when sample result lead to no rejection  of null.hypthesis 
when it was false inreal
probability of comitting it is denoted by 
Beta  (1-Beta)power test...


tradeoff between two:
if we reduce alpha to reduce type 1 error
so by default probab of type 2 increases

type 1 decrease = type 2 increase
thats why significance is alpha = 0.05 



*****************************************
ONE SIDED VS TWO SIDED TEST
ONE SIDED (ONE -TAILED)TEST:
is used when researcher is interested in testing the effect
in a specific direction 
(either greater than or less than value in null hypothesis)
ex. whether new medication inrease healing more than prevoius one

two more types
right tailed:
more value increase result 
left tailed:
new mwthod will reduce result

TWO SIDED (TWO-TAILED)TEST:
is used when researcher is interested in testing the effect
in both  direction 

ex.lays will have less than or greater than 100g weight

ADVANTAGE VS DISADVANTAGE:
TWO TAILED:
ADVANTAGE:
can detect effect in both directions.....
more conservative as alpha is split in two side so type 1 error is reduced
DISADVANTAGE:
less powerful...because alpha is split in two tails leading to type 2 error risk
not appropriate for directional hypothesis .....
ONE SIDED (ONE -TAILED)TEST:
ADVANTAGE:
more powerful....
diectional hypothesis...are appropriate

DISADVANTAGE:
missed effects,.....
increased type 1 error 



2.P VALUE APPROACH:

is probab of getting a sample as or more extreme (having more evidence again H0)
than our own sample given null hyp is true.
it tells us evidence strength against null hyp

e.g coin toss of head ...null hyp is 50 heads 50 tails and our test gave 53 heads so probab of getting
more than 53 heads is p value = 0.3 oe 30%
means out of 100 coin toss we get 53+ jeds 30 times


INTERPRETING P VALUE:

*a general rule that if p val <= alpha we can reject null hyp...
some scenerio where alpha is not given:
1. p<0.01 indicate string evidence we can reject h0
2. 0.01<p<0.05 indicate moderate evidnce against null evidence 
3. large p valye 0.05<p<0.1 indicate weak evidence 
4. p>0.1 weak or no evidence 

T-TEST:
no std...
works good on smaller size n 
is used to compare menas of 2 samples or sample mean to a known population mean
uses students T  distribution
*********

TYPES:

1.ONE-SAMPLE TEST:
is used to compare means of single sample to known pop mean
null hyp says no difference in sample and pop mean while alternate hyp says 
there is difference.
assumptions:
1. normal dist
2.independence
3.random sampling
4.unknown pop standard deviation



2.INDEPENDENT TWO-SAMPLE TEST:
used to compare means of two independent samples...
e.g class average of two sections A and B 
assumptions:
1.independence of samples
2.normal dist
3.equal variances(homoscedasticity):variance should be equal(F test or levene test)
4.random sampling


3.PAIRED T-TEST (DEPENDENT TWO-SAMPLE TEST):
used to compare means of two dependent samples.
eg.  same class calc training program..test before program and then after program
compare two average  is....dependent test
common scenerio of use:
1. BEfore and after studies
2. MAtched or correlated groups....

assumptions:
1.paired observations
2. normaliyy
3.independence of pairs


***************
shapiro test:
tells if no of values follow normla dist or not
e.g age of 58 poeple from titanic dataset
return p value
if p > 0.05  then its normal else not

F-TEST...
LEVENE TEST:
to check equal varainace of 2 samples
