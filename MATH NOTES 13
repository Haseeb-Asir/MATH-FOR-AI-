**********************
BAYES THEOREM:
is fundamental concept in field of probab that describes how to update the
probabilities of hypothesis when given evidence.


thomas bayes introduced it.....
*****
P(A|B)= P(A) x P(B|A)/P(B)

LINEAR ALGEBRA:::::


is branch of maths that deals with study of linear systems,
which are set of equations involving linear functions of variables..
it is foundational subject in maths and has applications in many areas



why for ML:
good in generilazing concepts in higher concepts,,work in higher dimesions more than 4d
data representation is easy...text,video or aything....


VECTORS:
it is a point in a particular coordinate sytem
dimension..equals to cordinate of veector system

represent using [x1,x2,x3...xn] in coding

how used in ML.

feature vector..(convert all input features of all data points in dataset 
into or treat as vector)
feature vector are given as input to model to predict..

e.g movie recommender systems....create vector out of summary of movies.

ROW AND COLUMN VECTOR:
row = 1 x n
column = n x 1


ex in iris dataset:
150 flowers 
picking one flower would give row vec
while taking all type of flower species is column

DISTANCE FROM ORIGIN OF VECTOR :
 using pythhagoras theorem 
d = sqrt(a2 +b2 )
also possible for multiple vector dimensions 
d = sqrt(a2 +b2 + n2)

also known as magnitude of vector ||A||



EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE:

distance between two vectors

d = sqrt((x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2+n)

in ML:
nearest neighbour algorithm uses eucledian dist..
many algo use this internally 

SCALAR ADDITION/SUBTRACTION(SHIFTING):
add things to vector so it moves or is scaled so is sub
used in mean centering:
(calc mean of all x1 values from vector and minus mean each x1 and we get new 
vectors which are shifted,same for x2 and hence points are centered toward mean )


SCALAR MULTIPLICATION/DIVISION:
multiplication is done through
1.dot product(returs a scalar) more useful in ML

A.B = At(1xn) B(nx1)

rules:
is commutative a.b = b.a
is distributive a.(b+c) = a.b + a.c

uses :
used too comput similarity btw two vectors 
calc projections 
perform matrix multiplication
used in deep learning totally 

A.B = |A||B|cos0
*****
Cosine similarity:

cos0 = A.B/|A||B|
used in ml as similarity measure to find how much 2 vector are similar
ranges value form -1 to 1
compare angle 0 between both 
e.g used in movie recommendation 

2.cross product(returns a vector)
in 3d
twi fingers multiply then thumb upward in 90 degree is product



EQUATION OF HYPERPLANE:

plane more than 3d dimension 


for 2d eq of line is  y = mx + b
or general from ax + by + c =0


y= -a/bx -c/b

m = -a/b  , b = -c/a


w1x1 + w2x2 + wo = 0

w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 +  wo = 0

w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + wnxn  wo = 0



w.x +wo = 0

where w = [w1,w2,w3,wn]
x = [x1,x2,x3,xn]



Wt.X +Wo = 0



Wo will be zero if line passes through origin 

so Wt.X = 0 is eq of hyperplane simplified

W will always be perpendicular to X plane





🔹 Matrix Basics:
A matrix is a grid of numbers (rows × columns)
is a linear transformation result or to show them 
M1XM2 != M2XM1 HOWEVER 
A(bxC)=(AxB)C 

Used for data, transformations, solving equations

🔹 Key Types of Matrices:
Row Matrix: 1 × n

Column Matrix: n × 1

Square Matrix: same rows and columns

Identity Matrix: diagonal = 1s

Zero Matrix: all elements are 0

🔹 Matrix Operations:
Addition/Subtraction: same size only

Multiplication: not commutative

Transpose: flip rows & columns

Scalar Ops: add/multiply with a single number

🔹 Determinant & Inverse:
Det ≠ 0 → matrix is invertible

Inverse (A⁻¹): used to solve Ax = b

Use adjoint & cofactor if needed

🔹 Solving Systems:
Solve Ax = b using:

Inverse → x = A⁻¹b

Gaussian Elimination

LU Decomposition


****
UNIT VECTORS:
from origin to 1 on x and 1 on y 
vectors come from unit vectors...
i[1 0] j[0 1]
we get vector by multipying it with above

also called basis vector because every vector cn br created from them 
whenver we multiply unit vectors with scalar and we keep changing value of scalar 
then it might cover whole 3d space IR2



LINEAR TRANSFORMATION:
when coordinate system changes shape like skew tilt rotate
vector input --> f(x)--->output vector
conditions:
all lines must remain lines
no curves
lines shuld be evenly spaced
origin shouldnt move
grid lines should be parallel

if we apply onn pic in ml it will rotate etc 
ex Shear transformation:measn things get clustered or squeezed




scaler vector:

means multiply scalar with vector 
2[1 2] we get scaled value [2 4]

Span off vector:
the vectors that can be created from the vector available 

Linear dependence of vector:
when all vectors of span lie on single line in plane
done when x:y ration remains same 
e.g x=y,x=2y
or if we romove one vector from eq and stil span remains same 



X Y INTERCEPT:
x value mens when y is zero or line touches  on x axis 
y value mens when x is zero or line touches  on y axis

LINEAR EQUATION:
eq wisch gives line on plane..
types:
1.two variable:
2 variables x,y
2.Three variable eq:
3 variables x,y,z
3.Highar dimension eq:
